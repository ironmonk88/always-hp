# Always HP
Add-On Module for Foundry VTT

We're always updating HP.  So I added a window that makes it easier to do that.

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features
Any currently selected token will be affected by the changes from the Always HP window.
A single selected token will display the name and current HP.  Multiple selected tokens will show how many tokens are selected.
If the player only has one controlled token, and no token is currently selected, it will default to affecting the only token it could affect.

Click the skull, to set the HP to 0 and set the token's dead status.
Click the down arrow to take away HP, and the up arrow to heal by that amount.
Click the heart to heal the token fully and remove the token's dead status.  

Version 1.0.16 added functionality, Right-click the skull to set the HP to 0 and NOT set the token's dead status. Right-click the heart to fully heal without removing the dead status.

Version 1.0.17 added functionality, Shift click the skull to toggle the dead status.

Version 1.0.9 added functionality, pressing the enter key in the text box will either heal if there's a + in front of the text ie '+5' or hurt if there's a - out front, or nothing so either a '-5' or '5' will hurt the character.

By grabbing the window by the top bar it can be dragged around the screen and placed where it's most convenient for you to reach.
